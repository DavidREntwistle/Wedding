                    We are getting married in Co.Waterford where both our church ceremony and wedding reception venue are situated.
                    <br>
                    You can get to Waterford via the following routes;

                <p>
                    <strong>Manchester Airport to Dublin Airport:</strong>
                    <br>
                    2 hour drive from Dublin to Waterford
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Manchester Airport to Cork Airport:</strong>
                    <br>
                    1 hour 45 min drive from Cork to Waterford
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our experience is that the cheaper late flights from Manchester are often delayed.
                    <br>
                    If possible we recommend avoiding the last flight out of Manchester especially if planning to pick up a hire car which often closes at midnight.
                    <br>
                    We normally fly with <a href="https://www.ryanair.com/flights/gb/en/flights-to-ireland" target="_blank">Ryanair</a>, but there is also a few other airlines such as <a href="https://www.aerlingus.com/en-gb/flights-to-ireland" target="_blank">Aer Lingus</a>.

                    We've previously sailed with <a href="https://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/Travel-to-Ireland/" target="_blank">Irish Ferries</a> from Holyhead to Dublin.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    The ferry departure times do vary; it's worthwhile checking each of these companies and also other port locations.

                <h3>⛐DRIVING🛣️</h3>
                <p>
                    Driving in Ireland is very similar to driving in UK.
                    <br>
                    Please take extra care on country roads as they are often narrow with sharp corners, slow-moving tractors, and no street lighting.
                    <br>
                    Speed signs are also in kmh rather than mph.
                    <br>
                    Your current UK car insurance should cover driving in Ireland; separate cover shouldn't be needed.
                    <br>
                    However, make sure to check any limitations with your current insurance provider.
                    <br>

                <h3>🚗HIRE CAR🚙</h3>
                <p>
                    We frequently fly from Manchester to Dublin and hire a car with Dollar or Hertz through booking.com.
                    <br>
                    We have used Dollar & Hertz for several trips and both were positive experiences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>🚌MORE OPTIONS🚕</h3>
                <p>
                    If you prefer to not drive there are several bus route (<a href="https://www.buseireann.ie/" target="_blank">Bus Eireann</a> & <a href="https://jjkavanagh.ie/" target="_blank">JJ Kavanagh</a>) options from Dublin airport to Waterford.
                    <br>
                    Our recent journey with Bus Eireann was convenient, comfortable and on time.
                    <br>
                    Bus route is approximately 3 hours.
